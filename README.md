# TODO

## General
* [ ] Consider directory refactor (+ compile target change), to reduce clutter

## Assembler
* Implement file I/O
  * [x] Read ASM file
  * [x] Write to output textfile
* Scan file twice, once to find all loops and once more to generate code

## Tests
* [ ] Compare our final assembler output against the fibbonaci example given (after loop handling is finished)
* [ ] Try edge cases defined in the PDF (long lines...)
